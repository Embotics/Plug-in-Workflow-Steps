# Plug-in Workflow Step Packages

This repository contains plug-in workflow step packages.

These packages can be used in Embotics vCommander workflow extension scenarios. Some of these packages can also be used outside Embotics scenarios.

You can find the files required for scenarios in the [Scenarios repository](https://github.com/Embotics/Scenarios). You can find complete scenario documentation on the [Embotics Support Knowledge Base](https://support.embotics.com/support/home). 

Plug-in workflow steps are supported with vCommander release 7.0 and higher. 

See [Adding plug-in workflow steps](http://docs.embotics.com/vCommander/Using-Plug-In-WF-Steps.htm#Adding) in the vCommander documentation to learn how to install plug-in step packages.
